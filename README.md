## TimeSeriesForecastingInR

#It includes the following:
	• Understanding statistical characteristics of time series data like stationarity, autocorrelation, and patterns like trend and seasonality.
	• Baseline models such as naïve, mean, drift methods; and advanced models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, STL Decomposition and built-in neural network.
	• What to look for and how to approach trend-only data, seasonal-only data, data that has lots of patterns Vs. data that has lots of randomness/noise.
	• Visualizations of both data and model forecasts, along with interactive visualizations.
